1\. National housing shortage

The U.S. has a chronic shortage of homes. Coastal states are particularly affected, with [**California**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_housing_shortage) and [**Washington**](https://crosscut.com/2020/01/report-washington-should-have-built-225600-more-homes-over-past-15-years) facing huge challenges. The cause? Demand for housing continues to grow faster than the development of new housing. New reports estimate the nation-wide shortfall at [**4 million housing units**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/housing-market-falling-short-by-nearly-4-million-homes-as-demand-grows.html). Some sources claim the actual figure is closer to [**double that amount**](https://www.upforgrowth.org/new-report-indicates-housing-shortage-more-severe-once-thought).

A housing shortage is most evident at lower price points, making it difficult for many first-time buyers to become homeowners. But the crunch is now affecting the [**luxury segment**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/the-shortage-of-homes-for-sale-is-getting-much-worse-even-in-luxury.html), too. This trend looks set to continue: the deficit is growing at [**300,000 housing units**](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/the-conundrum-that-affordable-housing-poses-for-the-nation/) annually.

2\. Homeowners staying put for longer

Because of tight supply and decreasing affordability, existing homeowners who want to move have relatively fewer options from which to choose. So many are simply deciding to stay put for longer.

The average U.S. homeowner now spends 8 to [**13 years**](https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2020/01/13/where-owners-are-the-most-least-likely-to-move) in their home, depending on which source you believe. Whatâ€™s clear is that the _tenure for homeownership_ has increased dramatically in recent years.
