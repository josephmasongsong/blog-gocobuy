## Year of the Pig

The Year of the Pig is officially underway, and with it a “[...lucky lunar cycle inclined to bring prosperity and wealth.](https://www.latimes.com/home/la-hm-chinese-lunar-new-year-of-pig-20190129-story.html)” In this update, we explore the key drivers set to shape housing markets around the Bay in the months ahead. Here's to _health_, _wealth_, and _good vibes_ in this Year of the Pig.

A glitch in the matrix?

# **Home prices across the Bay have demonstrated volatility over the last twelve months. Journalists have had a field day. Depending on the media outlet, home prices either rose by** [**double digits**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ingowinzer/2019/01/22/what-you-need-to-know-if-you-are-investing-in-california-real-estate/#2713e8a39a4e) **or** [**took a tumble**](https://sf.curbed.com/2019/1/3/18166996/december-home-prices-sf-oakland-drop-2018) **in 2018. But we need to compare apples to apples.**

Bay Area Median List Prices sky-rocketed in 2018, but finished the year flat

The _Median List Price_ for a home in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward Metropolitan Area shot up 18% in the first five months of last year, with similar gains seen in the San Jose-Sunnyville-Santa Clara Metro. From June onwards, however, the _Median List Price_ in both Metros began a steady decline that saw these gains erased on a year-on-year basis. In January 2019, we saw the _Median List Price_ in the SF Metro drop by 2% with no month-on-month change in the SJ Metro.

Bay Area Sales Prices were mixed in 2018

The _Median Sale Price_ of a single-family home across the Bay Area dropped by 3.6% in the twelve months through December 2018, according to [California Association of Realtors](https://www.car.org/marketdata/data/countysalesactivity). But this figure doesn't tell the whole story. Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, and Solano Counties saw the _Median Sale Price_ for single-family homes increase year on year.

Condos fared better. The Median Sale Price for a Condo across the Bay Area rose by 5.2% in 2018. Again, this varied on a county by county basis.

Overall, Bay Area homes appreciated in 2018

To get a clear view on developments in the housing market, we need to compare apples to apples. Home prices fluctuate over time and according to geography. But in any given month, the homes that are bought and sold may be skewed in terms of type or quality. _Median List Price_ and _Median_ _Sales Price data_ don't help us here. Instead, we look at indices.

Home Values increased in both the San Francisco Metro (+7.6%) and the San Jose Metro (+7.0%) in 2018.

**Jargon Busting**

**List Price**: the price at which a seller advertises a property for sale on the market.

**Sale Price**: the price at which a seller and a buyer agree to transact. The _median sale price_ for a given data set is the price “in the middle” of all sale prices when arranged in order of value. Referencing the _median sale price_ instead of the _mean sale price_ is useful as it reduces skew from outlying data points.

**Home Value**: a proxy for the value of a property, or how much it is "worth". Ultimately, the true determination of value can only be established through transacting. Most homes in a particular geography aren’t on the market, so indices are constructed in order to monitor fluctuations in local home values in aggregate.

So while it's true that Median List Prices dropped in the second half of 2018 (and in January 2019), this hardly paints an accurate picture of price action. Bay Area Home Values have trended upwards.

## Why did home sales decline in late 2018?

Home sales have [declined over the past several months](https://sf.curbed.com/2019/1/2/18165468/san-francisco-home-sales-drop-numbers-2018-figures). Armageddon? Hardly. Several factors contributed to the drop in home sales and the drop in _Median List Pric_e: seasonality, higher borrowing costs in the second half of 2018, and buyer fatigue.

**_Seasonality._**

Traditionally, residential real estate transactions follow a seasonal pattern (see chart below). Activity often peaks around summer and tapers off into December/January. Family considerations, school calendars, holidays, and historical precedent all figure in. Incidentally, as home prices reached new peaks in summer 2018, more sellers came to market in early autumn.

**_Affordability._**

Home prices have increased steadily since their post-recession lows. To compound this, the cost of borrowing shot up. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose from around 4.5% in July to nearly 5% in November. An increase of 50 basis points increases the total cost of borrowing $400k by more than $43k over the full term of repayment. This means an increase in the monthly repayment of about $120 (excluding taxes, insurance, and incidentals like private mortgage insurance).

**_Buyer Fatigue._**

The market context has favored sellers for a long time. Last year, some folks grew tired of placing offers on homes only to see their offers rejected time after time (you may have heard about "[bidding wars](https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/SF-s-top-5-over-bids-for-2018-show-how-crazy-the-13482104.php)").

This confluence of factors - **seasonality, decreasing affordability, and buyer fatigue** - put a check on runaway price appreciation.
