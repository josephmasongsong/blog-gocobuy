## Springin’ Forward

As I write this month’s Bay Area housing market update, the sun is shining gloriously across the East Bay. Spring is on its way. Spring is traditionally a busy season for residential real estate, and we are already seeing the signs of increased activity.

In our update [last month](https://blog.gocobuy.com/bay-area-housing-market-update-feb-2019/), we looked at how market dynamics evolved over the course of 2018 and into this year. Building on that analysis, we expect to see activity heat up around the Bay over the coming months. Buyer fatigue and increased borrowing costs called skyrocketing home prices into check last year. Our view takes into account pent up demand, fresh demand/seasonality, scarce supply, reduced borrowing costs, and a strong local economy.

From conversations with our clients and our network of [CoBuy-certified™ Pros](https://www.gocobuy.com/certified-pro), it is clear that many folks (understandably) are looking at how to approach the buy vs. rent decision. We frequently encounter three common misconceptions about what is required to purchase a home:

1. A down payment of 20% is required
2. “Perfect” credit is required
3. Student loan debt has to be (or should always be) paid off before buying a home

None of these is accurate:

* The average U.S. homebuyer under 40 years old puts down 8.8%, and many buyers qualify for substantially lower down payments.
* Numerous programs exist for borrowers who have less than “perfect” credit scores.
* The existence of outstanding student loan debt does not preclude one from buying a home.

As always, there are many factors at play here. We will be covering these and other topics in upcoming posts, but if you are itching for answers we would love to [hear from you](https://blog.gocobuy.com/bay-area-housing-market-update-mar-2019/#contact).

## Price action

Home prices and values are measured in different ways. Many factors influence movements in these levels from month to month, and from one locale to the next. Both _home prices_ and _home values_ reflect signs of "buyer fatigue" on one hand, while fundamentals could exert upward pressure. Last year we saw substantial volatility across the Bay (see** [**last month’s update**](https://blog.gocobuy.com/bay-area-housing-market-update-feb-2019/) for more).

Bay Area Median List Prices: bounced in February

Let’s start by looking at the median list price for two Metropolitan Areas: the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward Metropolitan Area and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara Metropolitan Area. In mid-2018, we saw a big spike in the median list price in both jurisdictions. Median list prices retraced their gains over the course of 2018, but are trending back upward in February.

Bay Area Median Sale Prices: mixed

The last month for which we have _median sale price_ data is January. January is typically one of the least active months in the year for home purchases.

**Single Family Homes**

**Condos/Townhomes**

Source: data from [CAR](https://www.car.org/marketdata/data/countysalesactivity)

We see a sizable monthly dip in _median sale price_ across most counties, both in single family homes and condos/townhomes. But median sale price performance over a twelve month period tells a different story (for most counties listed). We expect the data for February and March to show month-on-month gains.

Bay Area Home Values: mixed performance

Below, we break out _home value_ performance by city. It is evident that performance varies by jurisdiction. Again, note: the latest month for which data is available is January. January is typically one of the least active months in the year for home purchases.

If we look at changes in _home values_ over a twelve month period (through Jan 2019), we see strong performance in all but Berkeley and Oakland. This excludes numbers from February, which we would expect to be higher.

**Jargon Busting**

**List Price**: the price at which a seller advertises a property for sale on the market.

**Sale Price**: the price at which a seller and a buyer agree to transact. The _median sale price_ for a given data set is the price “in the middle” of all sale prices when arranged in order of value. Referencing the _median sale price_ instead of the _mean sale price_ is useful as it reduces skew from outlying data points.

**Home Value**: a proxy for the value of a property, or how much it is "worth". Ultimately, the true determination of value can only be established through transacting. Most homes in a particular geography aren’t on the market, so indices are constructed in order to monitor fluctuations in local home values in aggregate.

## Supply & Demand

Somewhat predictably, there are signs of increases on both the supply side and the demand side. A key factor is seasonality: historically there are fewer homes bought and sold during the December and January months. Furthermore, last year we saw mortgage rates increase into year end. This had a clear impact on the demand side of the equation. Many would-be buyers decided to put their purchases on hold in light of sustained price increases and a higher cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates have since decreased notably, making a home purchase relatively more affordable for anyone taking out a mortgage.

**Increase in the number of transactions in February**

February saw a jump in the number of homes that went under contract between buyers and sellers (pending listings increased). Pending listings are a forward indicator of home sales: the majority of these mutually accepted purchase and sale agreements will soon close.

**Increase in inventory in February**

The number of homes for sale increased in February.

**Inventory still remains rather lean by traditional standards**. _Months of inventory_, a proxy for how long it would take for all existing homes on the market to be sold, is low in both the SF Metro (1.7 _months of inventory_) and the SJ Metro (1.5 _months of inventory_). Traditionally, a balanced market is characterized by _months of inventory_ between 5 and 6 months. Still, the Bay Area housing markets can hardly be characterized as _traditional_. Between the third quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2018, months of inventory clocked in at even tighter levels versus today (but...for most of that period, prices were increasing.)

**Homes sold at a faster pace in February**

The number of days it takes for the average home to sell nearly halved from January to February of this year in both the San Francisco Metro Area (29 days in February) and the San Jose Metro Area (27 days in February). This compares to a national average of 83 days. This is supportive of strong demand for homes from buyers across the Bay Area.
