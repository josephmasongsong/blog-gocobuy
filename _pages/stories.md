### Candice & Gabriel
#### Unmarried Couple (Oakland)

"I didn't really know where to start because we had different financial situations. How would that work out? CoBuy walks you through the process...from the realtor to the mortgage, the lender to the lawyer, to help drafting up the agreement. I would recommend CoBuy to anyone looking to buy a home together"

### Christina, Edwina, Jason
#### Family members in Port Angeles, WA

“The CoBuy team actively encouraged us to smartly consider our options in terms of joint ownership. Now we live in an awesome house and have peace of mind knowing that we've covered all our bases and have contingency plans for all the ‘what-ifs’ that life can throw your way. I highly recommend CoBuy!"
