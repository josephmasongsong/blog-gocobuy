# Hello Greater Seattle!

##### After nearly a year of R&D and a little elbow grease, we are incredibly excited to announce that we are launching our site at [GoCoBuy.com](https://gocobuy.com/).

W e started CoBuy to help people jointly purchase property. People have different motivations for pooling resources to buy a home: some are driven by finances, some by family ties, and others are looking to co-invest. What’s clear is that houses are expensive. Really expensive. So it’s no wonder that we are starting to see more people deciding to co-buy residential property in the U.S., as Europeans have been doing for many years.

Let’s face it – the process of buying a home sucks. It’s complicated, there are a ton of moving parts, and everyone is trying to sell you something. So the added layer of complexity that comes with _jointly_ purchasing a home is not exactly ideal.

### Enter CoBuy

Our platform is devilishly simple. CoBuy makes it easier to approach joint financing, to find the right home, to determine the appropriate ownership structure, and to document the terms of the co-ownership arrangement. After kicking off the process via our online platform, co-buyers can progress at their own pace with as little or as much support as required. The end result is an efficient, intelligent way to co-buy a home.

Starting today, CoBuy is serving the greater Seattle area (including the ‘burbs). We’ll be rolling out new features and making a couple of exciting announcements over the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to [get in touch](https://blog.gocobuy.com/contact/) with us. We’d genuinely would love to hear what you have to say.
