## A penny for your thoughts!

**Commentary provided in response to the open-ended final question:**

_“I think it will be another strong spring. I am already getting activity and clients in contract in the first few days of the year.”_

_“I think the biggest driver in the region will be the job creation driven by Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and other companies hiring in the area.”_

_“I think that we will see more listings hit the market starting mid January from the people who waited for the holidays to be over. I believe that there will still be moderate competition for properties in the lower price points as first-time home buyers try to enter the market.”_

_“Appreciation should be moderate but there in 2019. Rates will continue to be volatile.”_
